# Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a project that I discovered within the Deliveroid 2.0 project. While working on the Deliveroid 2.0, I wanted to find a way to wirelessly communicate with the robot while it was moving throughout the environment. I did not want to use WiFi for this use case as I have worked with WiFi connections in the past on the Deliveroid robot and it had a bad habit of timing out the web browser every time you wanted to send repeated requests. I have decided, as a workaround, to use radio frequencies as a primary wireless control method as utilizing radio frequencies provides as faster way to send commands to the robot, without the need to refresh a browser with each command.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my first time using radio frequencies and like working with any new technology, I ran into a lot of problems and errors that I'd like to address here for both a reference and a guide for anyone wanting to use radio frequency communications to control their systems in the future.

# Hardware

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hardware I used in this project is in direct alignment with the hardware I used in the Deliveroid 2.0 project at the time. Since the Deliveroid 2.0 project uses multiple interfaces of hardware, I will be able to explain how I worked with radio frequency on both the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. The Deliveroid 2.0 uses the Arduino as the center hub for the robot's control. The Arduino controls motors and sensors on the robot. The Raspberry Pi is used for control of the Deliveroid 2.0 while it is remote and in the environment. The Deliveroid 2.0 is supposed to carry out tasks and receive commands from a fair distance from the user commanding the robot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raspberry Pi will act as the main command center to the Deliveroid 2.0. It should be able to command the robot remotely and receive information back from the robot based on its status. This is the main reason behind the effort to create a radio frequency network between the Arduino on the robot and the Raspberry Pi command center. With the NRF24L01 radio module, I could create this network between these two hardware devices as this module is able to work cross-platform.

### Raspberry Pi Connections

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To connect the NRF24L01 to a Raspberry Pi, I used the GPIO pins on the board. On the Raspberry Pi, I used the smaller on board antenna module since it works faster and the NRF24L01 library (which we will get into later) works better with it. However, if you want you could use the larger NRF24L01 module with the attachable antenna like the one in the picture above. They both have the same pinout:

Connections to the the Raspberry Pi is as follows:

<img src="/rpi3-1-11.png">

- **CE**: GPIO17
- **SCK**: SCLK
- **MISO**: MISO
- **CSN**: CE0
- **MOSI**: MOSI
- **IRQ**: NULL (no connection)

### Arduino Connections

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To connect the NRF24L01 to an Arudino, I hope you have a few Digital I/O pins available, because we are going to use another 5 of them. Since the NRF24L01 module used SPI, it takes quite a few connections to send and retrieve data. For the Arduino, I used the larger NRF24L01+PA+LNA module that has a detachable antenna. The reason behind this is because this module has a much longer range than the on board antenna module. I found this out the hard way as when I connected the on board module to the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi, the maximum range that I found to be possible was about 20 feet (6.1 meters) and there was almost no connectivity between walls. However, when using the detachable I was able to easily get 100 feet (30.48 meters) in range, I'm sure the distance goes way further than that but I can almost assure you that this setup will meet your range needs. Again, you can choose to use the on board antenna module in this setup as well, but, you will be dealing with significantly less max range.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pins on the detachable board are the same as the on board module. However, this module uses a lot more power than the on board module. You should still supply it with 3.3 volts of power, but this will cause some inconsistencies in your data transmission as power will be significantly lost when the board is activated. To stop this power drain, you have two ways to combat it:

1. Solder a capacitor between the Power and Ground pins on the module
2. (Recommended) Connect the module to a breakout board that has an on board voltage regulator and connect the board to 5V

Connections to the Arduino is as follows:

- CE: 9
- SCK: 13
- MISO: 12
- CSN: 10
- MOSI: 8
- IRQ: NULL (no connections)

# Software

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the software portion of this project, I want to walk through the current code I'm working with on the Deliveroid 2.0. This should give you a good idea of how to set up your own radio and how you can use hardware like sensors or motor controllers to send communications to and from your robot. Also, in this project I am interested in transceiver radio activity, meaning I want to both send and receive data from the NRF24L01 module. The NRF24L01 module is capable of being just a transmitter or received, but I have chosen for my use case to use both functionalities.

Before getting started with the code, you will need to import the library for the NRF24L01 module:

- [NRF24L01-Library](https://github.com/trueToastedCode/Python/blob/master/Fix/lib_nrf24.py "NRF24L01-Library")

Now we can dive into the code.

## Raspberry Pi Code

I am going to start with the Raspberry Pi code. Here I will show:

- How to set up the radio on the Raspberry Pi
- How the Raspberry Pi connects to the Arduino
- How the Raspberry Pi sends commands to the Arduino
- How the Raspberry Pi can send repeated requests to the Arduino

### Setting up the radio

```python
# import libraries
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
import spidev
import os
import sys
from lib_nrf24 import NRF24
from getkey import getkey, key

# radio config
GPIO.setwarnings(False)
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
pipes = [[0xE8, 0xE8, 0xF0, 0xF0, 0xE1], [0xF0, 0xF0, 0xF0, 0xF0, 0xE1]] # one pipe for sending, the other for receiving

radio = NRF24(GPIO, spidev.SpiDev())
radio.begin(0, 17, 4000000)

radio.setPayloadSize(32)
radio.setChannel(0x70)
radio.setDataRate(NRF24.BR_250KBPS)
radio.setPALevel(NRF24.PA_MAX)

radio.setAutoAck(True)
radio.enableDynamicPayloads()
radio.enableAckPayload()

radio.openWritingPipe(pipes[0])
radio.openReadingPipe(1, pipes[1])
radio.printDetails()
```

For the code above, I am setting up the configurations for the radio module. The code reads like this from top to bottom:

- Setting the GPIO pins to get ready to do something
- Creating pipes, we create two here, one for sending data, the other for receiving data
- Set the NRF module to the GPIO pins via SPI interface and begin the radio
- Setting the payload size, the number placed in the parameters is the max about of bits you can send to and from the radio
- Setting the channel, channels are in hexadecimal make sure you set a channel that is far away from the noise in your environment. If you are around any WiFi hotspots, those will take up the lower 25 channels so I would work with any channels higher in the spectrum. That is why I have chosen `0x70` here are as it is very far away from any noise in my environment
- Setting the data rate of the module. These modules have 3 different data rates, 250KBPS, 1MBPS, 2MBPS. The speed you choose will depend on how sensitive and how much data will be sent to the module. 2MBPS will allow you to transfer a lot of data, but this could shorten your max range. The 250KBPS speed will allow you to send less data, but you will have increased range and a less sensitive antenna, which will benefit you if you want a faster module
- Setting the power level. Here I have set the power level to its maximum becuase this will make my module work its hardest to send and receive data at a fast and reliable rate. This will balance itself out from the data rate we chose in the step before. If you are going to set your power level to its maximum option, make sure you have a reliable power source so that it can transmit data reliably.
- Setting auto acknowledgements so that the module is able to transmit data seemlessly, and dynamic payloads so we can send variable lengths amount of data (ex: 4 bits, 10 bits, 12 bits)
- Finally we open the writing and reading pipes that we created earlier so that the module can prepare itself to listen and send data. Then we print all of our radio details to the console

### Setting Commands for the Arduino

```python
# setting commands
option1 = list("FORWARD")
option2 = list("REVERSE")
option3 = list("RIGHT")
option4 = list("LEFT")
option5 = list("STOP")

# allowing user to choose commands
print("Choose an option: ")
key = getkey()

if (key == 'w'):
    option = option1
elif (key == 's'):
    option = option2
elif (key == 'd'):
    option = option3
elif (key == 'a'):
    option = option4
elif (key == 'x'):
    option = option5
elif (key == 'q'):
    option = option5
    print("Stopping Operation...")
    print("Quitting...")
    main_menu()
elif (key == 'z'):
    print("Stopping Operation...")
    option = option5
    print("Goodbye!")
    return True
else:
    print("This options is not valid. Please retry.")

while len(option) < 32:
    option.append(0)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the code above, I have created logic for each command that the robot should follow. At the beginning of the code I created commands under the variable name of `option`. The commands in the option variable will be cast to a `list`, this is because we still need to send data bit by bit if you remember from the code before this one. Each letter in the `option` command will be sent as a bit over the radio. If there are empty bits that can be sent after the `option` bits are sent, the data packet will be appended with 0's as seen in the last line of the code above.

The data packet will be sent like this:

```python
option = ['F', 'O', 'R', 'W', 'A', 'R', 'D', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Sending and Receiving Data to the NRF24L01

```python
while True:
    start = time.time()
    radio.write(option)
    print("Sent the command: {}".format(option))
    radio.startListening()

    # time out logic
    while not radio.available(0):
        time.sleep(1/100)
        if time.time() - start > 1:
            print("Timed out.")
            break


    # accept the received message
    receivedMessage = []
    radio.read(receivedMessage, radio.getDynamicPayloadSize())
    print("Received: {}".format(receivedMessage))

    print("Translating the received message from Deliveroid into readable text...")
    string = ""

    # decoding the received message into human readable text
    for n in receivedMessage:
        if (n >= 32 and n <= 126):
            string += chr(n)
    print("The received message from Deliveroid: {}".format(string))
    radio.stopListening()
    break
print("Cleaning GPIO")
GPIO.cleanup()
```

For the code above, I am creating the logic for receiving commands over the radio. The code reads like this from top to bottom:

- First, we start a while loop. This will be the main loop of the program where the Raspberry Pi should be retrieving info from the Deliveroid
- In the while loop, I started the time, this is will come in handy later
- I open the radio's writing pipe where I pass in the `option` command that will be read by the robot
- I then print out what command will be sent to the robot
- The program will now start listening for any data to be returned from the robot
- I created another nested while loop where the command will time out after some time waiting, this time, starting at the beginning of the while loop, now comes in handy and after a certain amount of time the command will timeout if there is no data that has been returned from the robot
  - I created this time out logic because if the robot goes to far from the Raspberry Pi, it has the effect of being disconnected from the radio communication. If that is the case, I need to know this feedback so I can access the situation, and the program won't be stuck waiting for a command that is never coming.
- If data if received from the Deliveroid, the Deliveroid will send back a message to the Raspberry Pi giving some status showing acknowledgement for the command
- For the next few lines, I created some logic to decode the command that the robot is sending back to the Raspberry Pi because it is being sent back as some non-human readable text and it needs to be translated back to human readable text
- In the last two lines of the program, I cleaned up the GPIO ports so that I can run through the code again with fresh GPIO ports to work with

## Arduino Code

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I am going to showcase the Arduino code. Remember, the Arduino is the center of command for the Deliveroid. The Arduino will receive commands from the Raspberry Pi command station and execute the command in physical form on the robot. The following code blocks will demonstrate this process

### Setting Global Variables

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <SPI.h>
#include <nRF24L01.h>
#include <RF24.h>

#define CommandTrigger 8 // LED
#define ChannelBuffer 7 // LED

// ce, csn pins
RF24 radio(9, 10);

// motor control for left side of robot
const int ENA = 5;
const int IN1 = 1;
const int IN2 = 2;

// motor control for right side of robot
const int ENB = 6;
const int IN3 = 3;
const int IN4 = 4;

void motorForward();
void motorReverse();
void motorRight();
void motorLeft();
void motorStop();
```

For the above code, I am importing libraries, setting pin connections on the board, and setting functions for motor control of the robot. The code is pretty self explanatory if you work with C++ or Arduino code often.

### Setting up setup() function

```cpp
void setup()
{
  // setting all motor driver pins
  pinMode(ENA, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ENB, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(IN1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(IN2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(IN3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(IN4, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(CommandTrigger, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ChannelBuffer, OUTPUT);

  // beginning serial connection to radio signal

  radio.begin();
  radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_MAX);
  radio.setChannel(0x70);
  radio.setDataRate(RF24_250KBPS);
  radio.openWritingPipe(0xF0F0F0F0E1LL);
  const uint64_t pipe = 0xE8E8F0F0E1LL;
  radio.openReadingPipe(1, pipe);

  radio.enableDynamicPayloads();
  radio.setRetries(0, 15);
  radio.setAutoAck(true);
  radio.powerUp();
}
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the code above, it is similar to the first one except now we are in the `setup` function. In Arduino code, the `setup` function is the second in line to be ran right after the global variables are set above this function. Here, I am setting pin modes for each pin on the Arduino, along with setting the values to the radio, this is similar to the code at the beginning of the Python code on the Raspberry Pi. As you can see we set the same values in this setup as we did on the Raspberry Pi, which makes sense, all radios in a network **must** have the same configuration in order to work properly with one another. I won't go into too much detail here, but you must be sure that your writing pipe and reading pipe are the same that they were in the Raspberry Pi code.

### Beginning the loop() function

```cpp
void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(ChannelBuffer, HIGH);
  radio.startListening();
  Serial.println("Starting loop. Radio on.");
  char receivedMessage[32] = {0};
  if (radio.available())
  {
    digitalWrite(ChannelBuffer, HIGH);
    radio.read(receivedMessage, sizeof(receivedMessage));
    Serial.println(receivedMessage);
    Serial.println("Turning off the radio.");
    radio.stopListening();

    String stringMessage(receivedMessage);
```

For the above code, I start the `loop` function. In Arduino code, the code inside the function will loop in a never-ending loop as long as the Arduino is powered. The code reads as follows from the top to the bottom:

- I set the `ChannelBuffer` to **HIGH** so that the Arduino is ready to accept a buffer of commands like `FORWARD` from the Raspberry Pi code
- Next, I set the radio on the robot to start listening for connections
  - The reason the radio will begin listening, rather than opening the writing pipe like in the Raspberry Pi code is because we are awaiting the command from the Raspberry Pi command. We can't write anything yet because we do not know what we are doing yet
- Once the radio receives the message, it will enter a conditional statement where it will read the received message
- The message will be printed to the serial monitor
- Then the radio will stop listening
  - We set the radio to stop listening because now that we have the command, it is time to execute that command and send back a status message to the Raspberry Pi. For that, we will need to open up the writing pipe. Both reading and writing pipe can not be open simultaneously
- In the last line of this code, we cast the received message to a string so that it can be read and interpreted by the C++ code.

```cpp
    if (stringMessage == "FORWARD")
    {
      digitalWrite(ChannelBuffer, LOW);
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, HIGH);
      Serial.print("Moving Deliveroid FORWARD");
      const char text[] = "MOVING FORWARD";
      radio.write(text, sizeof(text));
      motorForward();
      Serial.println("Command Completed.");
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, LOW);
    }
    else if (stringMessage == "REVERSE")
    {
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, LOW);
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, HIGH);
      Serial.print("Moving Deliveroid REVERSE");
      const char text[] = "MOVING REVERSE";
      radio.write(text, sizeof(text));
      motorReverse();
      Serial.println("Command Completed");
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, LOW);
    }
    else if (stringMessage == "RIGHT")
    {
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, LOW);
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, HIGH);
      Serial.print("Moving Deliveroid RIGHT");
      const char text[] = "MOVING RIGHT";
      radio.write(text, sizeof(text));
      motorRight();
      Serial.println("Command Completed");
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, LOW);
    }
    else if (stringMessage == "LEFT")
    {
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, LOW);
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, HIGH);
      Serial.print("Moving Deliveroid LEFT");
      const char text[] = "MOVING LEFT";
      radio.write(text, sizeof(text));
      motorLeft();
      Serial.println("Command Completed");
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, LOW);
    }
    else if (stringMessage == "STOP")
    {
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, LOW);
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, HIGH);
      Serial.print("Stopping Deliveroid");
      const char text[] = "STOP";
      radio.write(text, sizeof(text));
      motorStop();
      Serial.println("Command Completed");
      digitalWrite(CommandTrigger, LOW);
    }
  }

  delay(100);
}
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the code above, you can notice that there is a lot of repeated logic wrapped in a few conditional statements. If you look closely, each conditional statement contains a `stringMessage`, this string message is the command that has been sent from the Raspberry Pi code. If you remember back to the Raspberry Pi code, these string messages match up to the `option` variable from that program. When the command matches up to one of the string messages, the robot should perform that corresponding motor control function. For example, if the string message equals **FORWARD**, then this will trigger the `motorForward` function in the Arduino code and cause the motors on the Deliveroid to move forward.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the command is received and triggered on the robot. The program will send a status message back to the Raspberry Pi command saying that the command was completed successfully. We do this for all motor functions on the robot so that the Raspberry Pi can access all the motor functions from in the robot.

# Wrap-Up

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen a lot of people online say that the NRF24L01 modules are really difficult to hookup and use in their projects. I hope that this project tutorial helped in some way clear up some of the confusion that you may have when working with these small but powerful boards. For my use-case, I just needed a way to have bi-directional communication over some distance and these modules worked perfectly for that. However, if you are looking into radio frequency engineering, whether it be wireless communications or wireless networks, then I'd suggest these boards are the right tool to get you started.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this was a mini project that I found while working on the Deliveroid 2.0. If you'd like to learn more about the Deliveroid 2.0 project, then I'd highly recommend checking out its repository, all code is openly available to reference and use!
